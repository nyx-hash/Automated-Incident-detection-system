Prerequisites for Setting Up the Network Intrusion Detection System
To set up the complete environment for the network monitoring application, you'll need:

1. Development Tools
Node.js: Version 18.x or 20.x
npm: Included with Node.js
PostgreSQL: For database storage (version 13 or higher)
Git: For version control
2. JavaScript/TypeScript Environment
TypeScript compiler
Vite (build tool and development server)
React development tools
3. Required npm Packages
Core Dependencies
npm install react react-dom typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react
npm install express express-session
npm install @tanstack/react-query
npm install wouter
npm install drizzle-orm drizzle-zod @neondatabase/serverless
UI Components
npm install lucide-react react-icons
npm install tailwindcss tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate
npm install @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-dialog
Network Analysis (for local deployment only)
npm install node-netstat network-address
4. Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database
Set up the DATABASE_URL environment variable
Run database migrations
5. Training the ML Model
If you want to train the machine learning model:

Python 3.10 or 3.11
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
joblib
6. Data Set for Training
For training the model:

NSL-KDD or KDD Cup 99 dataset for network intrusion detection
You can download it from: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html
Local Machine vs. Replit
On Replit: Most dependencies are managed automatically
On a local machine: You'll need administrator privileges to access network information
For real network monitoring, the application may need to run with elevated permissions
This setup will allow you to run the application and even extend it with real network monitoring capabilities if you're running it locally with the proper permissions.



Windows Setup Guide for Network Intrusion Detection System
To run this application on Windows, you'll need to install the following software and packages:

1. Core Software
Node.js: Download and install the latest LTS version (18.x or 20.x) from nodejs.org
PostgreSQL: Download and install from postgresql.org
Git: Download and install from git-scm.com
2. Network Monitoring Tools (for Real Network Analysis)
WinPcap or Npcap: Required for packet capturing - download from npcap.com
Wireshark: Provides TShark for advanced packet analysis - download from wireshark.org
3. Setup Instructions for Windows
Install Node.js and npm:

Run the Node.js installer you downloaded
Make sure to select the option to install npm
Select the option to add Node to your PATH
Install PostgreSQL:

Run the PostgreSQL installer
Remember the password you set for the postgres user
Keep the default port (5432)
Create a Database:

Open pgAdmin (installed with PostgreSQL)
Create a new database called "network_intrusion"
Set an environment variable DATABASE_URL with your connection string:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/network_intrusion
Clone and Setup the Project:

Open Command Prompt as Administrator
Navigate to your desired folder
Clone your project or create the folders as shown earlier
Place all the files in their correct locations
Install Dependencies:

cd network-intrusion-detection
npm install
Windows-Specific Configuration:

Open the file package.json and modify the scripts section:
"scripts": {
  "start": "node dist/server/index.js",
  "dev": "set NODE_ENV=development && tsx server/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc && vite build",
  "db:push": "drizzle-kit push"
}
4. Running the Application on Windows
Development Mode:

Run Command Prompt as Administrator (for network access)
Navigate to your project folder
Run: npm run dev
Production Mode:

Build the application: npm run build
Start the server: npm start
5. Troubleshooting Windows-Specific Issues
Access Denied Errors: Make sure to run Command Prompt as Administrator
Netstat Commands Failing: Windows uses a different format for netstat, but the code has Windows-specific parsing
Firewall Issues: You might need to allow the application through Windows Firewall
PATH Issues: Make sure Node.js and PostgreSQL are in your system PATH
The network analyzer is designed to automatically detect if it's running on Windows and adjust the commands accordingly, so it should work out of the box with the right permissions.
