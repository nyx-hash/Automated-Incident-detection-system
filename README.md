Prerequisites for Setting Up the Network Intrusion Detection System
To set up the complete environment for the network monitoring application, you'll need:

1. Development Tools
Node.js: Version 18.x or 20.x
npm: Included with Node.js
PostgreSQL: For database storage (version 13 or higher)
Git: For version control
2. JavaScript/TypeScript Environment
TypeScript compiler
Vite (build tool and development server)
React development tools
3. Required npm Packages
Core Dependencies
npm install react react-dom typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react
npm install express express-session
npm install @tanstack/react-query
npm install wouter
npm install drizzle-orm drizzle-zod @neondatabase/serverless
UI Components
npm install lucide-react react-icons
npm install tailwindcss tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate
npm install @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-dialog
Network Analysis (for local deployment only)
npm install node-netstat network-address
4. Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database
Set up the DATABASE_URL environment variable
Run database migrations
5. Training the ML Model
If you want to train the machine learning model:

Python 3.10 or 3.11
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
joblib
6. Data Set for Training
For training the model:

NSL-KDD or KDD Cup 99 dataset for network intrusion detection
You can download it from: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html
Local Machine vs. Replit
On Replit: Most dependencies are managed automatically
On a local machine: You'll need administrator privileges to access network information
For real network monitoring, the application may need to run with elevated permissions
This setup will allow you to run the application and even extend it with real network monitoring capabilities if you're running it locally with the proper permissions.
